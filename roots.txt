/Introductive Memo

These writings are my notes on the world. Perhaps they would appear incandescent to the average reader and require the heat of devoted study. In any case, let it be known that I was here, so that there might be an analysis in all of these lost memories, those fluttering butterflies of faith that allow us to breathe. If I might gain notice, I would like to cast a light on these colorful flutters, but to do so, I must also risk crushing such beauties, curing the winged pastels under my shoes. Such is the true horrors of recollection, but to me, it is my destiny to do as such, to destroy innate convictions and bask in the light of sorrows!

Thus I declare, let it be known to myself henceforth: that my life would be filled with great turmoil, but it would be more magnificent and more joyful than any man in history!
