/Purpose

    I must understand its limits (or rather the limits of reason), so I can concentrate my creative energy into actionable fields of discussion and avoid becoming dogmatic or insincere. I also want to read Schopenhauer, who demands that I should understand Kant (and Plato) before engaging with his great work "The World as Will and Representation".

    More generally, Kant would seem to the be greatest philosopher in history, and deserves our time and respect in almost any case. Therefore, I must read him and be sure not to misinterpret him in any way - a feat that would seem impossible, given our differences in time and culture. Still, I must at least attempt to scale the peaks of Kant so that I might understand his general line of thinking at a basic level, if not one that would provide a practical use for my understanding of the world - and will therefore read Kant's other two critiques after this as a matter of assertation and deference.
